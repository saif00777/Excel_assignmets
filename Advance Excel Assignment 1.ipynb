    "The individual rectangular boxes created by the intersection of rows and columns are referred to as cells in an Excel sheet. The combination of the column letter and row number serves as the cell's individual address or reference (e.g., A1, B2, C3, etc.). Data of all kinds, including text, numbers, formulas, and functions, can be stored in cells."

    "6. When to use a relative cell reference in excel?\n",
    "When referencing a cell in an Excel formula that can vary depending on where the formula is located in relation to the cell being referenced, you should use a relative cell reference. When a formula in cell C1 that references to cell A1 is copied to cell C2, the reference to A1 will immediately become a reference to cell A2. When you want to utilise the same formula on several cells or ranges without having to manually change the references, this kind of referencing is helpful."
